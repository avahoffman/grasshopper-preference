Do grasshoppers prefer genetically different cultivars of *Bouteloua* grass?

Grasslands throughout North America are threatened by land use change. Fortunately, many areas are able to be restored to native prairie. Restoration of dominant blue grama grass (*Bouteloua gracilis*) in the shortgrass steppe remains a challenge, however. Low seed germination and establishment in native populations may force restoration managers to use selectively bred native accessions or cultivars. Yet, these cultivars may have experienced selection for high growth rates and rapid establishment, leading to greater palatability for herbivores. Insect herbivores in particular may hinder restoration efforts if they selectively prey upon cultivars. However, no studies have addressed differences between cultivar and native blue grama accession palatability or insect herbivore preference. 

We performed an experimental study to test the palatability and preference of native versus cultivar blue grama by grasshopper herbivores. We found strong evidence that cultivar blue grama was more palatable than native as well as weak evidence for grasshopper preference of cultivar plants. Water content was similar between the two grass types and is thus unlikely to determine feeding behavior. Nutrient composition results were mixed however, revealing greater carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratios in cultivar plants but no differences in silica content. 

This study indicates that choice of accession in shortgrass steppe restoration efforts could have broader ecological effects. Herbivores may be particularly impacted by different nutrient availability among plant ecotypes. Managers will have to weight the costs and benefits of commercial cultivars versus uncultivated native accessions when considering how they might be affected by arthropod herbivores.
